# Glossary


**Service:** a building block for a project - services can provide data/files, visualize results (2D, 3D), implement code in JupyterLabs or perform computations to execute simulations within a study.

**Study:** a project on the online platform where you can build your workflow with **Services**.

**Template Study:** a study that you may reuse in your own work. Clicking on a template will create a copy of that study, which will appear in your own **Studies** tab with the same name as the template. Any changes you make to this copy will not affect the original template.

**Workbench:** when you enter into an existing study, create one from scratch, you will be working within the workbench. This is where you will create and edit your pipelines, see your services, debug and run your study.
