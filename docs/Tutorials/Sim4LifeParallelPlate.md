# Sim4Life Tutorial: Parallel Plate

One of the first tutorials in the Sim4Life manual is a project applying the Electro Static solver to evaluate the electric field between two metallic plates. Here, we will discuss how to implement the same tutorial on the online platform using the **Jupyter Smash** service. You will learn how to upload a script, run it, view results, and share the study with another user. 

The original tutorial can be found [here](https://git.speag.com/simphony/Tutorials/-/tree/master/tutorials). We provide a slightly modified one for the online platform. To learn more about how to translate your Sim4Life scripts to work with the **Jupyter Smash** service, see [Adapting Sim4Life scripts to Jupyter Smash](../GeneralUsage/adaptscripts.md)

## Steps
Before beginning the tutorial, you will need to download an iPython notebook containing the parallel plate tutorial [here](https://git.speag.com/oSparc/z43-manual/-/blob/master/docs/Tutorials/services_jupyter-smash_tests_integration_assets_tutorial_emlf_parallel_plate.ipynb).
1. Create a new study by clicking the ```Empty Study``` card in the **Studies** tab of your **Dashboard**.
2. Double click anywhere in the empty space in your pipeline workspace to access the **Service Catalog** and click on the **Jupyter Smash** service.
3. Double click on the newly-created **Jupyter Smash** service to access the Jupyter Lab UI.
4. On the side panel of the UI, click on the ```Upload Files``` icon ![up](../Studies/Services/JupyterOctavePythonMath/SidebarMenu/Images/uparrow.png.png)
