# Welcome
Welcome to Z43's online platform for code storage and execution! The purpose of this platform is for scripts developed at Z43 to be:
* __Stored__: to make sure your code does not get lost (especially if you leave)
* __Shared__: accessible by other Z43 members
* __Executed__: requiring no installations and using shared computational resources
* __Organized__: findable and reusable by other Z43 members 

This documentation page is an extension of our [Primary Documentation](http://docs.osparc.io) where you can find more detailed explanations of various features.
### Quick Start
Register yourself with your Z43 email (i.e. ______@speag/zmt/itis.swiss) at: **https://osparc.speag.com**

Then, get started with one of our [Tutorials](Tutorials/Sim4LifeParallelPlate.md)
