A service is a building block for a study project - services can provide data/files, visualize results (2D, 3D), implement code in JupyterLabs or perform computations to execute simulations within a study. 

Every service has its own options that can be accessed by double-clicking on it. Services such as the [JupyterLab-based services](Studies/Services/JupyterLab/JupyterLabs.md) have extensive GUI interfaces while others such as [iSolve](Studies/Services/iSolve.md) only have input fields. that can be accessed. 

To add a service to your workbench, simply double click in an empty space in a study's **Workbench**. The Service Catalog will pop up, allowing you to select from a pre-existing menu of service types. When choosing a service, you may search for entries in the catalog using the search bar. 

When you click on a service's card in the catalog, you will also have the option of selecting a specific version of that service in the ```Version``` field, which is a dropdown menu. This was implemented for backcompatability. The default service version will always be the most recent, or "latest". Clicking the ```Add```button on the bottom of the catalog popup will add the selected service to your study's **Workbench**.

To delete a study, select it by either clicking on the service module in the pipeline, or selecting it in the **Service Tree**, located at the top of the sidebar of your study's **Workbench**. Then, click the ```Delete``` button in the **Service Tree**.

The following video demonstrates creating and deleting a service.
