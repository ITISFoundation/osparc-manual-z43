# Service

A service is a building block for a study project - services can provide data/files, visualize results (2D, 3D), implement code in Jupyter Labs or perform computations to execute simulations within a study. 

Every service has its own options that can be accessed by double-clicking on it. Services such as the [JupyterLab-based services](JupyterLab/JupyterLabs.md) have extensive GUI interfaces while others such as [iSolve](iSolve.md) only have input fields. that can be accessed. 

To add a service to your workbench, simply double click in an empty space in a study's **Workbench**. The Service Catalog will pop up, allowing you to select from a pre-existing menu of service types.
