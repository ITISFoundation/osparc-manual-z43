# File Picker
The *File Picker* service is one that allows you to upload files onto the online platform in order to use it as input to another service, such as **iSolve**. 

## Usage

One way to use this service is:
1. Drag and drop a file from your local file browser onto the workspace of your study - the file will be automatically uploaded into a *File Picker* service.

2. Access the service options by double-clicking the *File Picker*
3. Click the ```Upload``` button on the bottom right hand corner of the options
