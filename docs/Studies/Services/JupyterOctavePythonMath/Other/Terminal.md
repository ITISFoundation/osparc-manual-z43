It is possible to open a Unix-style terminal session inside a service.  To do so, click the "Terminal" icon under the heading "Other" in the main window.  By default, the terminal opens in the "home" directory.  To navigate to your projects, type:
```bash
$ cd work
```
and 
```bash
$ ls -a 
```
to display your files/directories, including hidden files, such as ".git", which indicates the presence of a git repository.
